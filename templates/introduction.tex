\chapter*{Introduction}
This is a collection of notes taken on {mp:name}. A large part of
the notes comes from \cite{lee2013smooth} with some background material on
topological spaces coming from \cite{munkres2000topology}.

We make the convention that a \textbf{\textcolor{jd_blue}{blue}} word is
to be the defined term that will be used in this text, and a
\textbf{\textcolor{jd_purple}{purple}} word is to be a synonym that may be 
found in other treatments of the subject. Example:
\begin{define*}
    Let $f: X \to Y$. A point $x \in X \cap Y$ is said to be a
    \defterm{fixed point}, or \altdefterm{invariant point} of $f$, if
    $f(x) = x$.
\end{define*}
