\chapter*{Introduction}
This is a collection of notes taken on concepts in {mp:name}.
% A large part of notes for \Cref{part:group_theory} come from
% \cite{dummit2004abstract}.

We make the convention that a \textbf{\textcolor{jd_blue}{blue}} word is
to be the defined term that will be used in this text, and a
\textbf{\textcolor{jd_purple}{purple}} word is to be a synonym that may be
found in other treatments of the subject. Example:
\begin{define*}
    Let $G$ act on $A$ from the left.
    The {\bfseries\color{jd_blue}{isotropy group}}, or
    {\bfseries\color{jd_blue}{stabilizer},} or
    {\bfseries\color{jd_purple}{little group}}, of $a \in A$ is the subgroup
    \[
        G_a := \set{a \in A : g \cdot a = a}.
    \]
\end{define*}
